# HR Workflow Designer

This repository contains a fully functional prototype of the **HR Workflow Designer**, a visual workflow-building application implemented using **React, TypeScript, React Flow**, and **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**.  
The project fulfills all required features from the assignment specification PDF, including workflow editing, node configuration, mock APIs, and simulation.

# Architecture

The application is structured into clear, modular layers to separate workflow visualization, business logic, and mock backend services.

 **Key Architecture Principles**
- **Separation of concerns**  
  Canvas logic, form logic, API logic, and validation logic are isolated into their own folders.
- **Modular component design**  
  Each node type (Start, Task, Approval, Automated, End) has its own form component for easy extension.
- **Unidirectional data flow**  
  Node updates flow from forms → App state → Canvas.
- **Mock API layer**  
  MSW simulates backend endpoints, allowing realistic async calls without needing a server.
- **React Flow for Graph Operations**  
  Handles drag/drop, connecting edges, positioning, and rendering custom nodes.
